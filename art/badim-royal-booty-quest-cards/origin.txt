Here are a deck of cards that doesn't look good(for players).

Created for a free card game - Royal Booty Quest

I was wondering - maybe it will be useful to somebody. If yes - I have more =)

List: 18 high-resolution(1024x750) vector images for cards.

PS This time I have changed size of images to 1024x750.
