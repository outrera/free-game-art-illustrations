Donating this HD space chick concept to opengameart since jumping ship and pursuing my JRPG which can be found here http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/mystictales-legend-of-the-janovi-gem-chapter-1.321518/page-2

If you guys would be so kind to donate anything you can to my paypal account at sonicmarkeus1989@yahoo.com so that I can continue develop my game.  Ofcourse you don't have to but anything and everything donated would be put to great use and it would be greatly appreciated.    As you can see I love donating too haha!
