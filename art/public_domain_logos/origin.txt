These are not my original creations, but a curation of a whole lot of clipart from OpenClipart.org that I've converted to black and white alphas at 2048x2048px, which can be used in art software for various purposes. I will be using them in Substance Painter.

All clip art on OpenClipart is public domain: https://openclipart.org/share

I've also included a few vintage images I've converted to alphas from the British Library Flickr, which is also full of public domain images scanned from books: https://www.flickr.com/photos/britishlibrary

Can also be used for particle effects
