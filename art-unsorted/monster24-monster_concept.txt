As my first submission, I've made a collection of 12 Public Domain Boss Sprites edited from various Public Domain Images I've found across the internet (Mostly via Wikimedia), put through GIMP, DeepStyle and Piskel from me to you!

They come in both normal and large versions and don't really have any backstories, but the names should give a hint as to authorial intent, and I hope that provides a good deal of inspiration for those downloading!

Apologies if the spriting is a bit wonky due to the various proceess I used to make them, feel free to clean them up when using them, because after all they're public domai! Have fun!
