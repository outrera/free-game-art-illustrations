I've noticed that there are not many ringed planets available for commercial project use, so I decided to make one myself. And since there are really no free-use ringed planets on the internet, except for maybe a Public Domain picture of Saturn, I decided to release this into the wild so that others may finally be able to use a ringed planet in their games.

This is the first ring planet I ever created, but I will be releasing more soon (and if anyone is interested.)

You may use this in any project, Commercial or Personal, as long as I get credit for it. And yes, you can modify, recolor, etc as long as you credit me for the original design.

I even included an RPG Maker VX Ace-ready version of it for those who need a planet for RPG Maker.

I hope this comes in handy for anyone who wants to make a space-themed game.
