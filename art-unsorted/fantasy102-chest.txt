A mash up of some graphics from the Glitch assets by Tiny Speck.

 The treasure chest I found in the collection had a pig head on the lock which probably doesn't fit the theme of a lot of games, so I removed it and made a normal padlock the main feature of the lock. Also made the end of the chain link actually appear to go around the padlock.
