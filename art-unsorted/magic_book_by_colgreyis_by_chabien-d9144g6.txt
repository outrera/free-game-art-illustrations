Hi colgreyis.
I have an issue in using your image for a WordPress theme : WordPress requires that all the content of a theme should be GPL compatible. It does not allow free images that have no license (more details here : themes.trac.wordpress.org/tickâ€¦).
Is it possible for you to add a Creative Common license to your work ? Or, do you mind if I republish your work as a new deviation with this Creative Common license (and your copyright) ?

Thanks
Fabien
